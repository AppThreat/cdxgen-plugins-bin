# Introduction

The files in this directory were copied from go binary distribution 1.21.4

```
cp /usr/local/go/src/cmd/go/internal/version/*.go .
cp /usr/local/go/src/internal/xcoff/xcoff.go .
cp /usr/local/go/src/internal/xcoff/file.go .
cp /usr/local/go/src/internal/saferio/io.go .

Few changes have been made to version.go and file.go to make the module compile
